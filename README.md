## 🎯 What is this?

`family-invite-2` is a small personal project I built to create a clean, simple, and responsive family-invite page. It’s meant for events like family gatherings, weddings, or any celebration where sharing a nice-looking, easy-to-access invitation makes things smoother.  

It’s a fully static page — just HTML, CSS/SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript — so it can be hosted anywhere or simply opened locally.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop  
- Easy to customize with your own event details, text, and images  
- SCSS support for cleaner styling and easier adjustments  
- No backend required — fast, lightweight, and easy to host  
- Comes with an assets folder for images and other media you might want to include  

## 📂 Project Structure

```
/
├── assets/         # images or media used by the invite
├── index.html      # main invitation page
├── README.md       # this file
├── LICENSE.txt     # project license
├── scss/ or css/   # styling files
└── js/             # JavaScript for small interactions
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started / Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ghinduta/family-invite-2.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` and replace the default content with the event details you want to display.  
3. If you use SCSS, recompile it after making style changes — otherwise you can work directly with the existing CSS.  
4. Host it wherever you want: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service. You can also share the HTML file directly.

## 💡 Example

Opening `index.html` in your browser will show you the invitation page as it is.  
Feel free to swap out images in the `assets/` folder, adjust colors or fonts in the CSS/SCSS, and customize the text however you like.

## ✅ Why I Built This

I wanted a lightweight and flexible way to share an invitation without relying on big templating platforms or backend services. A static page is fast, simple, and easy to personalize — perfect for family events.
